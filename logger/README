The easiest way to develop and compile this code is through the Arduino
IDE which you can get somewhere at arduino.cc. Note that you must also
download and install the Messenger and OneWire libraries.

In order to pull in a full NMEA sentence from the GPS, your Messenger
library needs a small modification to it's internal buffer size. By
default, it is 64 bytes large, but NMEA sentences can be a maximum of
82 (80 + <CR><LF>). During our development, we just set it to 90. If you
wish to make it smaller, you should also change GPS_MAX_SENTENCE_LENGTH
in libgps_arduino.h.
